Note: The jBPM support will be available in the next RC version.

jBPM it's a Open Source BPM that I've been using for years, 5 years I think so I can recommend it, even though it had some performance problems in the past now it's excellent. I took some heat to use it years ago mainly because people didn't understand what a BPM is. You can't use for everything (as you have to pay the price of resources) but when you got a clear case of business work flow that it's likely to change or if you need to create new functionality invoking different systems, resources, services etc.. in other words composition of services. 

The BPM gives you the flexibility of composing the services in a graphical way (using a Eclipse plugin, GPDL) that generates a readable xml. This way you can create/change without having to glue the services together and without having to code (well not that much :))


== jEmbedded jBPM Support ==

I have provided native support for jBPM that basically means you can reference the container services directly from the jBPM context (the jPDL file).

The support is provided by a new service: jbpm-service.

			<groupId>org.jsemantic.services</groupId>
			<artifactId>jbpm-service</artifactId>
			<version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

}}}

The service can be used as any other service of the framework or using a new core annotation: `@ImplementedByBPM`
