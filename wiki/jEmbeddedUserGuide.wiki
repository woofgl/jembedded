jEmbedded was born out of the necessity to use a container on the go, lighter and faster.

As I work as an Architect (any employers out there please contact me :) ) I find myself doing a lot of prototypes for applications or just trying new technologies so I need to create stuff pretty fast and if it doesn't work trying another one.

Many times this is not possible, because you have to install servers, frameworks, create services etc.. and then glue it all. Just try to make an Integration/SOA prototype with Mule (that is great by the way, hands off to the developers), you have to code, compile then copy the jars to the lib, setup the other servers you may need etc etc and then run, test, error.. you know what I mean.

First I designed jIntegration-Test, a integration testing framework to test the prototypes faster. That was good, I saved sometime but still I missed the possibility to compose this prototypes in a fast and reusable way, so I didn't have to start from scratch every time and in some way avoiding to install all that additional servers.

So that was how I designed jEmbedded, as a container for services (embedded or not) or other elements, that promotes re usability and composition and easy configuration. I started to code a few embedded services (services that run in the same VM) as a Web Server, a Embedded Database, a Mule Service etc.. so I didn't need to install them in my environment. And jEmbeded was born.


So what you can do with jEmbedded:

- Easy prototyping and testing of Integration/SOA or standalone/web applications (not only prototypes of course, can be used in final apps), using the provided services. Have a look at the ESB case study.

- Create services, package and distribute them. Then you can reuse them easily using service composition.

- As a container for the embedded services provided (jetty, tomcat, activemq, mule etc..)

- As a another IoC Container.

- As a helper container for Spring providing services or a facade layer of services. Have a look at the ESB case study and the spring-integration module.
