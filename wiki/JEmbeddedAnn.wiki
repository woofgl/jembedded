The core container provides a set of annotations that allows to configure the different elements of the framework.

The annotations can be imported as separate module if needed, for example to create a new service that doesn't need the whole framework dependency.

Most of the annotations can be used at a method level and at a method level. Some even at a field level.

As it's been told before the container it's a composition of 1-n repositories, so most of the annotations refers to these repositories and to the container. Except the @Container annotation that refers only to the Container.
