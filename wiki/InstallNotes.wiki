= Introduction =

- You would need MAVEN 2.x installed in your system.

- Copy the contains of lib-mvn\repository in your own maven repository. It contains 

dependencies that you can't download from other sites (jiservice, jicontainer..).


It does not contain Spring or other dependencies.

- Go to the src directory and type mvn clean install.

- It will download the needed dependencies from various sites.

- If you want to generate the eclipse projects type: mvn eclipse:eclipse.

- In order to user the framework (core) declare the following in your pom:

{{{
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.jsemantic.jintegration.test</groupId>
			<artifactId>jintegration-test-core</artifactId>
			<version>0.7-SNAPSHOT</version>
		</dependency>
}}}

		
		
- That's enough if you are only planning to use the HTTP or DB integration tests only.


== ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION. ==

In order to use the rest of modules you just need  to add module to the pom.

For example to use the ActiveMQ Integration test:
{{{		
		
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.jsemantic.jintegration.test</groupId>
			<artifactId>integration-jms-test</artifactId>
			<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
		</dependency>	
}}}

Also to use the jms module you are going to need to produce a integration-test.xml file

and put it the resource/META-INF/ directory of your project:

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">
	
	
	<import resource="classpath:META-INF/integration-jms-test/integration-jms-test.xml"/>
</beans>
}}}

You can get it from the config folder. This file is not needed neither for the core or the cxf/jsf/spring modules.

You can review the test from each module for examples of use and additionally a web example (in the examples folder).
