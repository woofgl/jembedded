= How to Install the Framework =

In order to use the framework you will have to get it installed in your maven repository so you will need to have Maven 2.x installed.

If you don't use maven you can find the framework distribution jars it the dist directory but you will have to get the dependencies yourself, and than can be a lot of work.


== Steps to install the framework == 

- Download the latest snapshot version from the downloads page.

- Unzip the file to the directory of your choice.

- Copy the contains of lib-mvn\repository folder into your own maven repository. It contains the dependencies that you can't download from other sites (jiservice...). It does not contain Spring or other standard dependencies.

- Go to the src directory and type {{{mvn clean install}}}.

- It will download the needed dependencies, compile, build, test, package and install the framework in your maven repository.



= How to use the framework in your projects = 

After having the framework installed you can reference the dependency in your project's pom:

{{{
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.jsemantic.jintegration.test</groupId>
			<artifactId>jintegration-test-core</artifactId>
			<version>0.9.3-SNAPSHOT</version>
		</dependency>
}}}

The core includes all the test modules except the JSF one. In future versions I will split the framework in different modules (and one in all version). In the meantime you can use the mvn exclusions if you don't want to import all the dependencies.

The jsf-integration-test module has it own dependency:

{{{
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.jsemantic.jintegration.test</groupId>
	                <artifactId>integration-jsf-test</artifactId>
	                <version>integration-jsf-test-0.2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
		</dependency>
}}}


- If you want to generate the eclipse projects just type: {{{mvn eclipse:eclipse}}}.
