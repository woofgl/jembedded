- You will need MAVEN 2.x installed in your system.

- Copy the contains of lib-mvn\repository folder in your own maven repository. It contains the dependencies that you can't download from other sites (jiservice, jicontainer..). It does not contain Spring or other dependencies.

- Go to the src directory and type {{{mvn clean install}}}.

- It will download the needed dependencies from various sites.

- If you want to generate the eclipse projects type: {{{mvn eclipse:eclipse}}}.

- In order to user the framework (core) declare the following dependency in your pom:

{{{
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.jsemantic.jintegration.test</groupId>
			<artifactId>jintegration-test-core</artifactId>
			<version>0.8.5-SNAPSHOT</version>
		</dependency>
}}}


That's all except for the jsf-integration-test module, in order to use it you also have to declare the dependency in your pom:

{{{
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.jsemantic.jintegration.test</groupId>
	                <artifactId>integration-jsf-test</artifactId>
	                <version>integration-jsf-test-0.2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
		</dependency>
}}}
