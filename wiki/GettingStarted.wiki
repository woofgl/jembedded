#summary GettingStarted

= Introduction =

An explanation about how to use the framework.

= Details =

Once you have the framework installed (see the install section) and the dependencies imported in your project you are ready to use the framework.

The way to use it will be very familiar to you if you have used JUnit before (I'm sure you did ;), specifically JUnit4 that's is annotation based.


== Steps to make an integration test unit == 

- Create a POJO class extending the abstract class IntegrationTest:

{{{

public class GenericIntegrationTest extends IntegrationTest {

}}}

- Add the annotations you need in order to run the test (class level), for example if you'd need a http test you could add either a @JettyService or a @TomcatService. If you  need a database you can add the @DatabaseService annotation. You can add and mix all the annotations (servers) you need.


{{{

@JettyServiceConfiguration(webApplication="src/it/resources/webapps/test")



public class GenericIntegrationTest extends IntegrationTest {

}}}
